      <h4 class="pt-5">A Long History</h4>
      <p class="heroText pt-5">
        James Howlett was born to wealthy John and Elizabeth Howlett in Alberta,
        Canada, during the last years of the 19th century. As a child, he was
        frail and unhealthy due to his overactive mutant immune system and was
        neglected by his mother, who had been institutionalized following the
        death of her first son, John Jr., in 1897. James’s mutant abilities were
        triggered when his father was shot by the Howlett groundskeeper Thomas
        Logan, whom he did not know was his real father. James killed Logan,
        slashed the face of Logan’s son and his friend Dog, and left Alberta
        with a childhood friend, Rose O’Hara.
      </p>
      <p class="heroText">
        His healing abilities drove trauma from his memories, leaving him
        partially amnesiac. He and Rose found refuge at a British Columbia stone
        quarry, where Rose, claiming James was her cousin, gave his name as
        “Logan.” Within months, Logan’s powers were heightening due to the
        environment around him. He became healthier and gained senses to rival
        those of an animal, but also became more violent. To divert some of this
        pent-up rage, Logan partook in cage fights where his prowess earned him
        the nickname “Wolverine.” After accidentally killing Rose with his
        claws, Logan retreated into the woods where he lived as a feral beast,
        losing all of his former memories.
      </p>
      <h4 class="py-5">Slashing Skills</h4>
      <p class="heroText">
        Wolverine’s rapid regeneration powers allow him to bounce back from
        almost every type of bodily wound on the condition that his head remains
        firmly attached to his shoulders. Nevertheless, the time of each healing
        is understandably proportionate to the severity of the injury. His body
        is also immune to most poisons, drugs, and diseases; his agility,
        reflexes, and senses are similarly enhanced. Wolverine sees and hears
        things at distances far greater than those of ordinary humans. His sense
        of smell is even more magnified and he can recognize people and objects
        by scent alone, which, combined with combat and stealth training, makes
        him one of the world’s foremost trackers.
      </p>
      <p class="heroText">
        The most iconic of his natural weapons are six retractable, slightly
        curved, foot-long bone claws, three in each arm, beneath the skin and
        muscle of his forearms. He can, at will, release these claws through the
        skin beneath his knuckles. The claws are naturally sharp and tougher
        than normal human bone, allowing them to penetrate most types of flesh
        and natural materials.
      </p>
      <p class="heroText">
        He has an extra defense from the Weapon X program, where his skeleton
        was coated in the near-indestructible steel alloy known as adamantium.
        This adds an extra 105 pounds to his frame—or 47.6 kilograms in Mr.
        Howlett’s native metric system. Immediately after this procedure, his
        healing factor was slowed so that it might take weeks to recover from
        multiple wounds, but eventually the factor returned to full strength and
        speed. The adamantium renders his bones virtually unbreakable and his
        claws capable of penetrating almost any substance depending on its
        thickness and the force he exerts. His reinforced skeleton also enables
        him to withstand heavy physical pressure, giving his muscles sufficient
        force to briefly lift 800 pounds or more.
